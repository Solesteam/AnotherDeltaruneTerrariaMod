Once upon a time, a LEGEND was whispered among stars.
It was a LEGEND of RIGHT.
It was a LEGEND of SPITE.
It was a LEGEND of LIGHT.
It was a LEGEND of NIGHT.
This is the legend of CELESTIAL SIGIL
For millenia, LIGHT and NIGHT have lived in balance,
Bringing peace to the WORLD.
But if this harmony were to shatter...
a terrible Calamity would occur.
The sky will run purple with pestilence
And the land will bleed with viscera.
Then, her heart pounding...
The EARTH will draw her final breath.
Only then, shining with hope...
Three HEROES appear at WORLDS' edge.
A HUMAN,
A TERRARIAN,
And a PRINCESS FROM THE LIGHT.
Only they can seal the star gods
And banish the ANGEL'S HELL.
Only then will balance be restored,
And the WORLD saved from destruction.
Today, the KEEPER OF LIGHT-
The monument that gives this land stability-
Stands tall at the center of the earth.
But recently, another amalgamation has appeared beneath the sea...
And with it, the balance of LIGHT and NIGHT begins to shift... 


Yep this is a Deltarune themed Mod, it doesn't do much, I intend to someday give it compatibility with another one I personally liked and the Terraguardians mod so that you may forge your own party of heroes.
